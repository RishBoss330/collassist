---COLLASSIST OVERVIEW---
CollAssist is a website in order to assist students, primarily those from lower income backgrounds with their college applications. 
Our vision is to eliminate income discrepancies by uplifting low-income students by strengthening their college applications based on their merit. 
Through our tool, students can understand their own finances and/or financial issues better, and gauge their chances through a merit-based chance determiner. 

---SETUP GUIDE---
Step 1 - Download the entire repository
Step 2 - Ensure that all files and subfolders are in the same repository folder. Do not move any files out of subfolders. 
Step 3 - Execute the homepage.html command. 

---TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE---
1. If the fonts refuse to load and show up as Arial/TNR Sans-Serif, open and close the style.css file and try again. Also do ensure that the fonts' ttf files are in a separate fonts folder.
2. If some webpages do not load, the files could have been tampered with. A simple guide to reorder files is that HTML files are in the main repository folder, while other files have their own respective folders.

---LIABILITY CLAUSES---
CollAssist is not a college counselling service. CollAssist is not liable for any and all college results for students and users. It is simply a tool that acts as a convenience for students to gauge their abilities, and for low income students to understand their financial issues better.
